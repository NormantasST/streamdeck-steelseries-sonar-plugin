# Streamdeck Steelseries Sonar Plugin

I created my own Streamdeck plugin to control Steelseries Sonar app. I am in no way promising to maintain or keep the project updated.

## Donating / Commercial Use

This project is free to use for personal and commercial use. It would be nice to contribute any amount to my [PayPal](https://www.paypal.com/donate/?hosted_button_id=M7YRNV44SUZV6) as Software Developers can not live on *free* if you find value from the project :)

## Features

### Audio Output Carousel

- **Rotates your current output device.**
- User can select if they want to include or exclude `Excluded Devices`.

## Special Thanks!

[SteelSeries GG - Sonar API reverse engineering](https://github.com/wex/sonar-rev) by Niko Hujanen for reverse engineering the OpenAPI definition which helped writing the tool.
